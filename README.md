  ## User Stories:

   As a competitor I'm seeing what my competition is like and perhaps asking for design tips.

   As a follower on social media I'd like to see what past projects are done and whats an upcoming piece of work.

   ## Major Hurdles/Learning Curves:

   This being my first MEN stack app was a huge learning curve to me and I can't say if there were any specific hurdles because the project as a whole was difficult from start to finish. 

   ## Next Steps:

   In the short term I'll probably look to add a loj in for admin, and spice up the CSS. Afterwards, depending on where my wife want to take the business the functionality may vary.
